			<p>2. In Chrome, the form has mm/dd/yyyy in the DOB section. In Safari and Firefox, it does not have the mm/dd/yyyy  in the DOB section. In addition, I added a video to my site. In Safari, I have to press the play button on my video before the control panel appears. Whereas with Chrome and Firefox, the control panel is present at the bottom of the video before I press the play button. Also, in Firefox the video appears on its side but in Chrome and Safari the video is right side up. On another note, in Chrome and Firefox I can see the name of my website without needing to open a new tab (it loads so that the page looks like a tab showing my website name). However, in Safari I can't see my website name unless another tab or multiple tabs are open. <br >
			3. Originally, when you click on the text next to each element, it does not bring the field into "focus". Only if you click on the DOB text does it bring that field into "focus". This is because the for and id attribute values tie the text and the field together, allowing users to click on the text to bring focus to the proper form control. This is important for tying the label and the field together to create an accessible form for all users and assistive technologies. <br >
			7. No, when I validated by code again after hosting it I  did not come across any new issues. It was cool that this time  I could past in my URL instead of uploading a file.
